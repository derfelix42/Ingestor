# Ingestor
Quickly ingest what ever you need into your digital life.

## Main Idea
There are many different ways to quickly capture something you want to preserve for later. Ingestor is the ONE.

With Ingestor, you can quickly enter some text, create a voice memo, take a photo, make a video, store your current location... or any combination of them!
Ingestor shall be the simplest way for you to capture anything you feel relevant enough.

And later, once you got the time, you can review your notes and pass them forward into some other system, like calendars, note taking apps, ...

## Platforms
To effectively use Ingestor to its full potential, it should be available on any platform you regularly use. There will obviously be a website on which you can access all your data. But we will also develop apps for Android / IOS to capture much quicker from there. That way we hope to cover all areas with which you would want to capture.

_Maybe there will also be a voice assistant, you can place in your room. So you only need to say "Hey Ingestor, \<your note to take\>"_

## How to use Ingestor
Ingestor is under development at the moment and you can't use it so far. The goal for Ingestor is to be self-hosted by who ever want's to do so. For anyone not wanting to self-host, there will also be a paid service.
